My project is called pyForth. | A minimal python Forth implementation.

I think forth is interesting from a programming lang. perspective for two reasons.
	1. Forth is a stack based language, which feels foreign or even backwards to many
	current programmers.
	2. The Forth interpreter is highly extensible, allowing for the programmer to define
	language features that behave just like built-in parts of the language.
